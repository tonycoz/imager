Imager-File-PNG 1.002
=====================

 - update bundled Devel::CheckLib with a fix to backported changes

Imager-File-PNG 1.001
=====================

 - update bundled Devel::CheckLib with more backported Changes

Imager-File-PNG 1.000
=====================

 - update bundled Devel::CheckLib from CPAN with backported changes

Imager-File-PNG 0.99
====================

 - fix palette/transparency table generation when writing paletted PNG
   images with tranparency.  This happened to work for the test case,
   but the mechanism used to generate the palette order preserved most
   palette index positions, which hid the problem with actually
   generating the PLTE and tRNS chunks.
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/499

 - added lowish-level read() and write() class methods to
   Imager::File::PNG, these are mostly intended for
   Imager::File::APNG, but are documented and usable elsewhere.

Imager-File-PNG 0.98
====================

 - MANIFEST.SKIP updates

 - fix validation of values for Latin1 tags

Imager-File-PNG 0.97
====================

 - when writing a paletteed image with an alpha channel only
   set the tRNS chunk if the image has transparent colours.  With
   older libpng this could add an erroneous tRNS chunk (or possibly
   undefined behaviour if I understand the libpng code).
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/issues/459

Imager-File-PNG 0.96
====================

 - update the bug tracking URL to point at github
   https://github.com/tonycoz/imager/pull/466

Imager-File-PNG 0.95
====================

 - Imager has moved to github

Imager-File-PNG 0.94
====================

 - Makefile.PL / metadata improvements

Imager-File-PNG 0.93
====================

 - add support for setting the level of zlib compression used with the
   png_compression_level tag.

Imager-File-PNG 0.92
====================

 - update the bundled/modified Devel::CheckLib to handle the gcc-4
   symlink on Cygwin

Imager-File-PNG 0.91
====================

 - skip the benign tests before libpng 1.6.0 since older versions do
   not treat an extranrous palette as any sort of error.

Imager-File-PNG 0.90
====================

 - support libpng 1.6.10.
   1.6.10 changed CRC errors from benign errors to normal errors,
   which broke the test which used CRC errors to check for benign
   error support.  Switched to using a 1-bit grey-scale image with a
   palette to test for benign errors.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=94717

Imager-File-PNG 0.89
====================

 - treat a version mismatch between library and headers as a probe
   failure.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86659

 - the check for benign error support is more complex than a simple
   library version check, check for the appropriate macro.
   Thanks for Slaven Rezic for following up on my CPAN Testers result
   queries.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=86659

Imager-File-PNG 0.88
====================

Distributed with Imager 0.96_01.

 - support libpng 1.6
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85746

Imager-File-PNG 0.87
====================

 - update README

Imager-File-PNG 0.86
====================

 - clean up .dSYM directories generated performing probes on OS X
   Mountain Lion.

 - pass the --verbose command-line option through to Imager::Probe in
   Makefile.PL
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75878

Imager-File-PNG 0.85
====================

 - fix some compiler warnings, no functional changes

Imager-File-PNG 0.84
====================

 - libpng 1.5 specific probes were looking for libpng 1.4 filenames.

 - added alternative probe configurations that try to link libz, to
   handle a statically linked libpng.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=74043

 - PNG rework
   - improve error reporting
   - add png_interlace, png_bits tags
   - read paletted images as paletted images, including transparency
   - read 1 bit greyscale images as a type suitable for other file
     handlers to write as bilevel
   - read 16 bit/sample PNG as 16-bit/sample Imager images
   - write "bilevel" paletted images as 1 bit grayscale images
   - write paletted images as paletted images
   - write 16-bit (or higher)/sample images as 16-bit/sample PNG
     images
   - improved metadata support
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=29268

Imager-File-PNG 0.83
====================

 - no longer fallback to using DynaLoader to load the XS code
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75560

Imager-File-PNG 0.82
====================

 - modify to use the new buffered I/O functions instead of calling
   I/O layer callbacks directly.

 - handle I/O close errors properly

Imager-File.PNG 0.81
====================

 - update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69170

Imager-File.PNG 0.80
====================

 - the big types cleanup

Imager-File-PNG 0.79
====================

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't
   plan to continue receiving mail at that address.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68591

 - Makefile.PL updates to report library detection info back to the
   main Imager Makefile.PL.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9675

Imager-File-PNG 0.78
====================

Bug fixes:

 - don't access deprecated members of the png_structp.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=60242

 - cleanup testout on make clean

Imager-File-PNG 0.77
====================

Bug fixes:

 - add inc at the front of @INC so we don't pick up old installed 
   Devel::CheckLib

Imager-File-PNG 0.76
====================

Initial release based on Imager 0.77

The idea here is that you can depend on Imager::File::PNG and be sure
of PNG support.
