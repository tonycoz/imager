                         *** TODO ***
                        


Iolayer:
- Add scalar/mmap to iolayer
- Add close() code to iolayer
- Merge callback interface into iolayer
- Add interface for writing to all formats but tiff
- Add interface for reading for png (started), 
  gif (merge with cb patch), ppm and raw
- Add new tests once all formats support io_layer
- Implment the maxread threshold (Indicates how far 
  a library can read before it indicates that it's done).


Enhanched internal structure:

MultiImage & metadata support:
- Figure what interface should be between C and perl?
- How to store data in the C interface for tags/metadata?
  Support tiff's madness, i.e. tags and options.
- Error handling, make a general i_errstr object and arrange
  such that each image has an i_errstr object to hold its
  local errors?
- SEE design/represent.txt for proposed new structure and
  interface design that takes these factors into account.

New Features:
- Add mng support.

- Transforms, interpolated multidimensional lookup tables.
  Usefull for CMYK <-> RGB table lookup.

- Finish antialiased filled polygon function.


Clean up:
- Make sure everything is doable with the OO interface
  i_flood_fill() for example.
- Split the other classes into seperate files
  Imager::Font::TT, Imager::Font::T1, currently 
  an if statement is used to choose what code to
  run.
- Compile with memory debugging enabled and fix all leaks

- dynaload.c is strongly tied to perl

- Add mycalloc() and myrealloc() to the malloc() wrappers.

- should we overload <=> or cmp for Imager::Color objects?
  too many worms, leave it out

- should the interlace option for reading raw images have 
  symbolic names in the OO interface?



Format specific issues:
- should i_readgif returned colormap be an arrayref of 
  Imager::Color objects?  Note that this will break 
  compatibility with previous releases.

- if gif_delays is a number instead of an arrayref, use that 
  number for each frame

- provide patches for libgif and libungif that fix their bugs
  and give a useful extension interface.  Probe for the 
  installation of the patches in Makefile.PL to let gif.c
  know what features it can use.

- Add options for pnm, writer to save in any of the p1..P6
  formats.  Even if the input has 1 channel, write 3 and such
  cases.  Also allow ascii mode.  Need to be able to write 
  pbm images which needs ties to the quantization code.


Documentation:
- Add to the documentation
- Write a tutorial?
- Write a guide to installing the helper libraries
- Go through the entire project and add comments in pod
  so doco.perl can be used to read them.
