Imager-File-TIFF 0.88
=====================

 - handle SampleFormat = 2 by translating the signed integer values to
   unsigned by flipping their sign bits.

   Handle SampleFormat = 3 where possible.

   SampleFormat is ignored for paletted images.

   Mixed SampleFormat are be handled incorrectly, since libtiff
   returns only the first SampleFormat value, and an image with both
   an alpha channel and SampleFormat = 2 for color channels probably
   has a different SampleFormat for the alpha channel.

 - eliminate some warnings produced by GCC 4.7.2:

    - a set but otherwise unused variable,

    - an incompletely bracketed array of structures initialization, and

    - a format string error (with no security implications)

Imager-File-TIFF 0.87
=====================

 - fix some mismatched format strings/types

Imager-File-TIFF 0.86
=====================

 - update README

Imager-File-TIFF 0.85
=====================

 - for libtiff versions that support extended warning handlers (3.8.0
   or later), use them to avoid some global variables.

 - clean up .dSYM directories generated performing probes on OS X
   Mountain Lion.

 - pass the --verbose command-line option through to Imager::Probe in
   Makefile.PL
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75878

Imager-File-TIFF 0.83
=====================

 - no longer fallback to using DynaLoader to load the XS code
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=75560

Imager-File-TIFF 0.82
=====================

 - modify to use the new buffered I/O functions instead of calling
   I/O layer callbacks directly.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69912

 - handle I/O close errors properly

Imager-File-TIFF 0.81
=====================

 - check image file limits set by set_file_limits()

 - use TIFFReadDirectory() instead of TIFFSetDirectory() to step
   through IFDs, since that handles IFD loops.

 - update the bundled (and still modified) Devel::CheckLib
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69170

Imager-File-TIFF 0.80
=====================

 - the big types cleanup

Imager-File-TIFF 0.79
=====================

 - handle slightly different warning from libtiff 4.x
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=65268

 - replace (imager|tony)@imager.perl.org in the doc, since I don't
   plan to continue receiving mail at that address.
   https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=68591

Imager-File-TIFF 0.78
=====================

Split out from Imager.
